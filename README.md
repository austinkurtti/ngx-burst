# ngx-burst

## Running showcase app with ngx-burst

To start a local showcase server with ngx-burst in live development, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files in either the showcase app or ngx-burst library.
